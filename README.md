# PHP/MySQL Check-In
PHP scripts for logging users into the MySQL database. Hope to eventually modify to include inventory options as well. This has some essential features that should be noted.

## Features:
 - PHP Layout Generation
 - Shared functions (so we don't keep rewriting code)
 - Logs id and timestamp (as before)
 - Grabs student's name when student is in database
 - Generates form to enter information if student is not in DB

## Things to add:
 - CSS (ITS SO UGLY, but this is low priority)
 - .SQL file
 - Dropdown for major and graduation year (so students aren't all giving different options like CEE, CE, Computer Engineering, etc)
 
These scripts will live on Luna
